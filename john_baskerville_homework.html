            John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included japanning and papier-mâché; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this
            very day, bears his name.</p>

Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763.
              His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing. </p>

                Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style
                of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

                    to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”</p>
